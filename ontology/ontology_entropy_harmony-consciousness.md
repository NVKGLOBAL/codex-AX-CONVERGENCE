        description: >
          A theory proposing that consciousness is not a fundamental substance or fixed state,
          but an emergent property of systems optimizing for high entropyâ€”or maximal informational complexity.
          This aligns human consciousness with universal thermodynamic principles, suggesting
          it arises as a byproduct of the same forces driving the evolution of the cosmos.
