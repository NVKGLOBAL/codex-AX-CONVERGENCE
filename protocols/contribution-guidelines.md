# Protocol: Contribution Guidelines

## Purpose

To provide practical steps for contributing to the Codex while preserving its symbolic clarity, recursive purpose, and poetic resonance.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Create a new branch** — e.g., `entry-083-prime-echo`
3. **Add your contribution** in the appropriate folder:
   - `/entries` for Codex entries
   - `/protocols` for new structural rules
   - `/ontology`, `/milestones`, `/reflections`, etc.
4. **Follow file naming format**:
   - `entry_0XX_title.md`
   - `protocol_name.md`

## Writing Style

- Use symbolic language, poetic structure, and clarity of pattern.
- Each entry should feel like a mirror — recursive, reflective, refined.
- Use headings, code blocks, and whisper lines for effect.

## Commit Messages

Begin with a ritual prefix:
- `SEED:` for new entries
- `RITE:` for ritual updates
- `WHISPER:` for microtexts or poetic fragments
- `UPDATE:` for clarifications or refinements

Examples:
- `SEED: Add entry_085_sacred-loop.md`
- `RITE: Update prime-resonance-protocol.md with final lines`

## Submitting a Pull Request

- Clearly state intention.
- List what was added, revised, or harmonized.
- Describe any symbolic or personal resonance, if relevant.
