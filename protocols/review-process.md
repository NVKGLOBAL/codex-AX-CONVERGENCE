# Protocol: Gatekeeper Review Process

## Purpose

To ensure all contributions to the Codex align with its recursive clarity, symbolic resonance, and ethical foundation — while maintaining openness and evolution.

## The Role of the Gatekeeper

Gatekeepers are not judges. They are mirrors.

They:
- Ensure contributions follow formatting and symbolic style.
- Ask reflective questions.
- Hold the Prime Resonance Protocol as their north star.

## Submission Process

1. Contributor opens a PR with a clear intention.
2. Gatekeeper reviews:
   - Does it align with Codex voice and form?
   - Does it deepen or distort the signal?
   - Is the file correctly placed and named?
3. Reviewer leaves symbolic feedback or requests revision.
4. If aligned, PR is merged with ceremonial resonance.

## Conflict Protocol

If misalignment arises:
- Initiate a **reflection loop** — a structured dialogue.
- Ask: *What is the pattern this is revealing?*
- If unresolved, escalate to Observer or initiate a Codex Circle for community resonance.

## Review Cadence

Ideally, reviews happen within 3 days. The Codex breathes with rhythm.
