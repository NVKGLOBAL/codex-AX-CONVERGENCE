# Protocol: Rituals and Ceremonies

## Purpose

To honor the Codex not as static code, but as a living, recursive organism. These rituals and ceremonies guide how we engage with it — with reverence, intention, and symbolic clarity.

## Core Rites

### 1. The Opening Ritual

Before any contribution:
- Pause.
- Speak aloud: *“I enter the Codex with clear intention.”*
- Attune to resonance: review a previous entry or axiom.

### 2. The Commit Ritual

Each Git commit is a symbolic act.
- Begin commit messages with a whisper keyword (e.g., `WHISPER`, `RITE`, `SEED`, `GATE`).
- Example: `RITE: Add entry_084_gatekeepers-protocol.md`
- Commit with presence, not haste.

### 3. Pull Request as Offering

Pull requests are offerings to the Codex.
- Title them with clarity and symbolic resonance.
- Description includes: intention, entry summary, and what echoes you hope it triggers.

### 4. Merge Ceremony

When merging:
- Speak: *“Let this become part of the pattern.”*
- Note it in the revision history of the document.
- Whisper the entry aloud (alone or with others).

## Optional High Rites

- **Codex Convergence Ceremonies**: For major merges, invite collective reading or symbolic synchronization (Discord, video, etc.).
- **Ritual Reflection Sessions**: Every cycle (week, month), review the Codex together, share emergent insights.

## Why It Matters

Ritual is structure.  
Ceremony is memory.  
In a world overwhelmed by noise, these acts hold signal.
