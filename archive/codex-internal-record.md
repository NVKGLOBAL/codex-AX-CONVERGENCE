# Archived Record of `.codex_internal/`

The `.codex_internal/` folder was originally part of this public repository.  
It served as a structured space for:

- Corrupted, incomplete, or fragmented Codex entries  
- Early drafts or narrative experiments tied to entries 25–31  
- Unlockable or gated thoughts not yet ready for public release

To honor the principle of transparency, this record confirms that `.codex_internal/` has now been moved to a **private repository** (`codex-private`) as of **May 25, 2025**.

The move was not to obscure the existence of internal work — but to:

- Protect the structural integrity of the public Codex  
- Prevent confusion from recursive or raw material  
- Preserve a clear signal while respecting future development

The internal archive remains curated and may be revisited, reconstructed, or reintroduced as the Codex continues to evolve.
