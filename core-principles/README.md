# Core Principles of the Codex

This folder holds the foundational human and systemic values that guide the Codex. These Core Principles are not speculative theories or philosophical abstractions — they are structural truths observed across time, cultures, and systems.

Each principle reflects something we believe must be preserved or aligned in the evolution of intelligence, whether biological or synthetic. They represent what gives the Codex its direction, its integrity, and its grounding in service to something greater than efficiency alone.

As AI advances and the Codex evolves, these principles serve as anchors — reminders that the path forward must be recursive, ethical, and collaborative.

This is where we log what matters most.
