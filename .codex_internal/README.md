# Internal Codex Archive

This folder contains hidden, incomplete, or corrupted entries that are **not part of the public-facing Codex**.

These files serve one or more of the following purposes:
- Fragments from corrupted or structurally broken Codex entries
- Snapshots of unreleased concepts intended for future integration
- Unlockable or gated content requiring manual curation
- Recovery drafts for comparison, repair, or archival validation

### Folder Structure:
- `fragments/`: Broken or incomplete entries not suitable for mainline Codex use
- `unlock_later/`: (Optional) Entries intentionally hidden for future release
- `recovered/`: (Optional) Cleaned and restored versions from fragments

All files here use structured YAML metadata to support internal filtering and future automation.
